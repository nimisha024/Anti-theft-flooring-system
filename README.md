This system is powered by Raspberry pi and it includes two tiles for demonstration purpose, with Piezo sensors. Whenever the thief enters in the house, and steps on the floor immediately it will send a message on IOT system.

Project Description: Security and safety have always become a basic necessity for the urban population. With the rapid urbanization and development of big cities and towns, the graph of crimes is also on the rise.
